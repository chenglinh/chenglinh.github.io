Previously, I obtained my bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University, where I've had the privilege of collaborating with Prof. [An-Yeu Wu](https://access.ee.ntu.edu.tw/) and Prof. [Yi-Chang Lu](https://sites.google.com/view/ldps-giee-ntu/home/advisor).

Next, I will join Prof. [Stella Yu](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~stellayu/)'s group at UMich CSE as a Ph.D. student, starting 2024 Fall.
